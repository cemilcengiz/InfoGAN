InfoGAN implementation based on "InfoGAN: Interpretable Representation Learning by Information Maximizing Generative 
Adversarial Nets", which can be found at <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03657.pdf>

Note that the actual experiment directories are the ones ending wit "_exp".
Specifically MNIST_exp, CelebA_exp, Chairs_exp, SVHN2, Conditional_InfoGAN_MNIST_exp, Conditional_InfoGAN_greyscale_exp and Conditional_InfoGAN_rgb_exp.
The remaining files are temporary and should be deleted in future commits
